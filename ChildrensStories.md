Selina's idea was to model children's stories, which are much simpler.
And so there'd be less temptation to boil the ocean.
But it would hopefully help with developing a framework that would then
be expandable to more complex plots.

The first idea being "stories in a zoo".
So we need events, and emotional reactions to those events.
And then we can find characters that have a nice arc.

- viewing different animals, their antics
- getting food, eating food, dropping food
- weather setting, and sudden changes
- seeing all the people - their clothes, etc.
- talking with the zookeepers and stuff
- trying to read (sounding things out)
- making friends
- getting lost
- using a map
- borrowing someone's map
- various locations being closed, animals not being visible
- seeing people you know from (school, church, the playground, the neighborhood)
- kids asking questions about animals (is it dangerous, have you ever seen one in the wild)
- getting tired. if you get too tired, you nap on a bench.
